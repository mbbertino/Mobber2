second mobber


#This is my final mobber project

##Description
With our 3rd day of class done, we were instructed to build this website from a png file. I believe that mine turned out well and gave me a much better understanding of position and HTML/CSS. My only problem came when my retina mbp would not capture the colors to an exact match.
